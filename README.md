# Stock Sentiment Analysis with LSTM

This project integrates financial news sentiment analysis with stock trend prediction using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. It utilizes **FinBERT**, a financial sentiment analysis model, to extract sentiment scores from financial news and combines them with stock price trends to forecast stock movements.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis with FinBERT**: Extracts sentiment scores from financial news articles.
- **Stock Trend Prediction**: Uses LSTM to analyze past stock prices and sentiment data for trend forecasting.
- **Automated Data Processing**: Parses stock and news data, normalizes features, and prepares datasets for training.
